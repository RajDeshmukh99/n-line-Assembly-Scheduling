# n-line-Assembly-Scheduling

Assembly line scheduling helps us to understand and know how tasks are to be assigned to workstations, so that the predetermined goal is achieved. Minimization of the number of workstations and maximization of the production rate are the most common goals. This project thus addresses the problem of scheduling the cloth manufacturing unit's time on identical parallel machines (assembly lines) to minimize total weighted time required for manufacturing using Dynamic Programming. 
Dynamic Programming uses a bottom up approach to build up the final solution. The solution of a problem is formulated recursively in terms of sub problems however we construct the solution for the bigger problem by first solving the smaller problems then combining the solutions of the sub problems and examining a model that incorporates the efficiency/timeliness conflict in practice. We propose properties of an optimal solution for the purpose of exposing to reduce the total time required for the production in the cloth production unit.
